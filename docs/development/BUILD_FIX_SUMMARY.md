# 🔧 Build Fix Summary - API Routes & Import Paths

## 🚨 Issues Identified & Resolved

### **1. Vercel Build Failure**
**Problem**: Build was failing during Vercel deployment with module resolution errors.

**Error Messages**:
```
Failed to compile.
./src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/amenities/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../services/databaseService'

./src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/tenants/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../services/databaseService'

./src/app/api/tenants/[tenantId]/properties/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../services/databaseService'

./src/app/api/user-profiles/[userId]/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../services/databaseService'
```

### **2. Incorrect DELETE Route Implementation**
**Problem**: The DELETE route in amenities API was trying to access `amenityId` from params, but the route structure only provides `propertyId`.

**Error Location**: `src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/amenities/route.js`

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### **1. Import Path Corrections**

**Root Cause**: API routes had incorrect relative import paths to `databaseService`. The paths were calculated incorrectly based on the directory nesting depth.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/amenities/route.js`
- `src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/tenants/route.js`
- `src/app/api/tenants/[tenantId]/properties/route.js`
- `src/app/api/user-profiles/[userId]/route.js`

**Correct Import Paths**:
```javascript
// Before (Incorrect)
import databaseService from '../../../services/databaseService';

// After (Correct)
import databaseService from '../../../../../services/databaseService';
```

**Import Path Structure**:
```
src/app/api/amenities/route.js → ../../services/databaseService
src/app/api/auth/login/route.js → ../../../services/databaseService
src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/amenities/route.js → ../../../../../services/databaseService
src/app/api/user-profiles/[userId]/route.js → ../../../../services/databaseService
```

### **2. DELETE Route Fix**

**Problem**: The DELETE route was trying to access `amenityId` from the `params` object, but the route structure `/api/properties/[propertyId]/amenities/route.js` only provides `propertyId` in params.

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```javascript
export async function DELETE(request, { params }) {
  try {
    const { propertyId, amenityId } = params; // ❌ amenityId not available in params
    // ...
  }
}
```

**After (Correct)**:
```javascript
export async function DELETE(request, { params }) {
  try {
    const { propertyId } = params;
    const { amenityId } = await request.json(); // ✅ Get amenityId from request body
    // ...
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Technical Details

### **Import Path Calculation**

The correct import path depends on the directory nesting depth:

```
From: src/app/api/properties/[propertyId]/amenities/route.js
To:   src/services/databaseService.js

Path calculation:
1. Go up from 'amenities' to '[propertyId]' (1 level up)
2. Go up from '[propertyId]' to 'properties' (2 levels up)
3. Go up from 'properties' to 'api' (3 levels up)
4. Go up from 'api' to 'app' (4 levels up)
5. Go up from 'app' to 'src' (5 levels up)
6. Then go into 'services' directory

Result: ../../../../../services/databaseService
```

### **Route Structure Analysis**

The API routes follow Next.js App Router conventions:

```
src/app/api/
├── amenities/route.js                    # 2 levels deep
├── auth/login/route.js                   # 3 levels deep
├── user-profiles/[userId]/route.js       # 4 levels deep
├── properties/[propertyId]/
│   ├── amenities/route.js               # 5 levels deep
│   └── tenants/route.js                 # 5 levels deep
└── tenants/[tenantId]/properties/route.js # 5 levels deep
```

## 🚀 Build Results

### **Before Fix**:
```
